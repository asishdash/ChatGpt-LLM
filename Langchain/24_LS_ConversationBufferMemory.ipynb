It was sent to President Franklin D. Roosevelt on August 2, 1939, during the early stages of World War II. The letter warned Roosevelt about the potential development of atomic weapons by Nazi Germany and urged the United States to begin its own research into nuclear technology.\\n\\nIn the letter, Einstein and Szilard explained the scientific principles behind nuclear fission and emphasized the destructive power that could be harnessed from it. They argued that the United States should take the lead in developing atomic weapons to ensure that they would not fall into the wrong hands.\\n\\nThis letter played a significant role in the establishment of the Manhattan Project, a top-secret research program that ultimately led to the development of the atomic bomb. It is considered a pivotal moment in the history of nuclear weapons and the beginning of the nuclear arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union.'"
